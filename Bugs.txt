- Sometimes, when talking to a character twice, the 2nd time only the first letter of its text prints. Pressing any button afterwards makes the proper text appear.

-In larger texts by certain NPCs (the first Owl text on the entrance of the Woods is a clear example), the VWF tends to glitch-up at around the 13th or so line of text. I have been able to replicate this in other larger texts as well, or simply trying out any new text with many new lines (12+, almost always on the 13th one) (Dialogs 0BE, 0F5)

- Certain texts get their starting letter erased for some reason (Dialogs 0DE, 0F0, 119, 11B, 124, 133, 135, 13C, 180, 1AA, 1AB, 1AC, 1B0, 1B1, 1B2)
Seems like the first letter gets replaced by an 8x8 tile (2nd to last or last tile) with letters or a blank space from the first or 2nd line. (Something related to the last letter it prints before @, as that's when it overwrites the letter)
